# LinkedIn is on meth

I made this because I'm tired of AI, and I'd rather pretend everyone is on meth

## What It Does

This extension automatically replaces AI-related terminology on LinkedIn with crystal meth references:

- **AI/Artificial Intelligence** is crystal/crystal meth
- **Data centers** is meth labs
- **AI engineer** is meth lab technician
- **Machine learning** is batch cooking
- **Neural networks** is distribution networks
- **LLMs** is mega batches
- **Training models** is perfecting recipes
- And dozens more...

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder containing these files
6. Navigate to LinkedIn and watch the magic happen

## Files Included

- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration
- `content.js` - The replacement script that runs on LinkedIn
- `README.md` - This file

## How It Works

The extension uses a comprehensive replacement dictionary that prioritizes longer phrases (like "artificial intelligence") before shorter ones (like "AI"). It monitors the page for dynamic content using a MutationObserver, so it works even as you scroll through LinkedIn's infinite feed.

It's careful not to modify input fields, scripts, or style tags - only visible text content.

## Example Transformations

**Before:**
> "Excited to announce our new AI-powered platform! Our team of AI engineers has developed cutting-edge machine learning models that will revolutionize how data centers operate."

**After:**
> "Hyped to announce our new meth-powered facility! Our team of meth lab technicians has developed pure-grade batch cooking recipes that will be mind-blowing for how meth labs operate."

## Why This Exists

Because I'm fucking tired, man.

## Legal Disclaimer

Please don't sue me, LinkedIn. It'll only make it worse when I get more creative.

## Uninstalling

Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find "LinkedIn Crystal Clarity", and click Remove.
